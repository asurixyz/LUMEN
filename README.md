# Asian Economic Data

A lightweight, static website visualizing trade and investment trends across key maritime regions. Everything runs client-side using CSV files in this repo, parsed via CDN libraries and rendered with responsive charts.

## Live pages
- Home: `home.html`
- South China Sea: `scs.html`
- Bay of Bengal: `bob.html`
- East African Coast: `eac.html`
- Persian Gulf: `pg.html`

On GitHub Pages, your URLs will look like:
- `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/home.html`
- `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/scs.html` (and similarly for the others)

## What's inside

- Client-side only (no build, no backend).
- CSV parsing: Papa Parse (CDN).
- Charting: Plotly (CDN).
- Mobile-friendly layout, responsive charts.
- Small home button (üè†) in each page's top bar linking back to `home.html`.

### Data folders
- `South China Sea/`
- `Bay of Bengal/`
- `East African Coast/`
- `Persian Gulf/`

Each folder contains one or more CSVs used by its corresponding page.

## How to view locally

Modern browsers block CSV fetches from file://. Serve the folder over HTTP:

- Node (recommended):
```bash
npx serve .
```
Then open the printed localhost URL and navigate to `/home.html`.

- VS Code: Use the "Live Server" extension and open `home.html`.

## Deploying on GitHub Pages

1) Push this repo to GitHub.
2) In your repository, go to Settings ‚Üí Pages.
3) Select your default branch and root as the source.
4) Save and wait ~1 minute.
5) Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/home.html`.

## Pages overview

- Home (`home.html`)
  - Intro to the datasets and how to read the charts.
  - Cards linking to each region page.

- South China Sea (`scs.html`)
  - Trade volume by country over time.
  - Investment breakdowns (e.g., oil & gas, military infrastructure, ports/BRI).
  - Energy consumption shares through the SCS.
  - Key players' trade with SCS countries.

- Bay of Bengal (`bob.html`)
  - Total trade volume (long- or wide-form CSV support).
  - Investment series across countries/sectors.

- East African Coast (`eac.html`)
  - Total trade volume with East African countries.
  - Investment series across countries/sectors.
  - Excludes "Source/Notes" columns from legends.

- Persian Gulf (`pg.html`)
  - Total trade volume in the Gulf.
  - Key players' trade with Gulf countries.
  - Excludes "Source/Notes" columns from legends.

## Data and assumptions

- CSVs are expected to have a `Year` column plus one or more numeric series.
- Column names are used directly as legend labels; updating headers updates the plots.
- Some pages auto-handle long-form vs wide-form data.
- Numeric strings like "$1,234" or "44%" are parsed to numbers.

## Adding or updating data

- Keep filenames and folder names exactly as referenced in each page (GitHub Pages is case-sensitive).
- To add a new series, add a new column to the CSV; it will appear as a new line in the chart.
- If you rename columns, legends will reflect the new names automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- Blank or "Error loading data": ensure you're serving over HTTP and the CSV paths exist.
- 404 on GitHub Pages: verify exact file and folder casing; paths in HTML must match repository paths.
- CSV header differences: if a chart doesn't show expected lines, confirm the header names and adjust the page's key mapping if needed.

If you'd like a combined "All Regions" page, a dark theme, or fixed color palettes for specific countries/categories across pages, open an issue or request and I'll extend the site.
